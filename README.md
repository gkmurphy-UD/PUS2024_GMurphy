This is the repo for Foundations of Data Science. More information to be added as class and assignments progress. 

I am a 2nd year PhD student previously taking courses in the computer science department to supplement my geospatial analysis skillset. My masters focused in GIS and am I looking to expand my data analysis skills beyond prediction and statistics, which is why I am excited to take this course. I am interested in learning how to better apply data science principles to real world issues and analyze/present data in an influential way that can push evidence-based policy decisions forward (especially concerning environmental justice). I have background in coding classes, but I am hahazardly trained with a sprinkling from many disciplines so I am looking forward to synthesizing my data science approach through this coursework for my dissertation research.
